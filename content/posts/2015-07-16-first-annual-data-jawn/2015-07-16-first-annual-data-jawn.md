I went to a data event last night called the Data Jawn, presented by RJMetrics, and wanted to share a write up of the event – it was pretty cool and sparked some really good ideas.

One idea I really liked – Predicting who will call in/have an issue and proactively reaching out to them… Sounds like a game changer to me. I could then trigger alerts when we see that activity or make a list for reaching out via phone, email, text… whatever. The possibilities of this seem pretty big.

There was also a lot of tweeting going on under the hashtag #datajawn.

Here’s some notes/takeaways from each speaker:

1. Bob Moore – RJMetrics CEO
  + Motto of RJMetrics: **“Inspire and enpower data driven people”**
2. Jake Stein – RJMetrics cofounder
  + “Be data driven”
  + Steps to all problem solving:
        + Collect Data
        + Analyze
        + Present Results
3. Madelyn Fitzgerald – RJMetrics
  + **“Need to be problem focused, not solution focused”**
        + This means that you need to ask a question of your data before building out the answer
        + Having KPIs is awesome… but they need to be built to answer a question
  + The most common problem people make with data is diving into the data before asking a question
4. Kim Siejak – Independence Blue Cross
  + IBX invested in hadoop last year
  + Doing a number of predictive models and machine learning
        + Predicting what people who will go to the hospital before they go
        + Predicting different diseases based on health history
        + Predicting who will call in before they complain
5. David Wallace – RJMetrics
  + [Every Important SaaS Metric in a Single Infographic](https://blog.rjmetrics.com/2015/05/19/every-important-saas-metric-in-a-single-infographic/)
  + **Document how every KPI is derived and make sure everyone understands it**
  + **“If you’re not experimenting, you’re not learning. If you’re not learning, you’re not growing.”**
6. Lauren Anacona/Christopher Tufts
  + Did a sentiment analysis on tweets with emojis
  + Pulled all the location based tweets from the Philadelphia area and visualized them on a map using CartoDB and torque.js (really cool visualizations!)
  + Lots of people use emojis!

7. Jim Multari - Comcast
  + “Dashboards are no good for senior leaders”
  + Only have 10 seconds to get your message across when talking to executives
  + Alerting on KPI changes
  + Four things needed to make a data driven org:
        + Right data & insights
        + Right data & systems
        + Right people
        + Right culture
8. Ben Garvey – RJMetrics
  + Pie charts are evil - you can estimate linear distance much easier than angular distance
  + **“Data visualization gives you confidence in state and trend without effort”**
  + You can tell the story much easier with the right visualization.
9. Stacey Mosley – Data Services Manager for the City of Philadelphia
  + Gave a talk about how they improved the use of court time for L&I
  + She didn’t share a lot about her processes or what data she used to do this…

There were a few other speakers to end the talk with nice messages, but by that point I was fully tweeting and stuck checking out what everyone else thought of the event.

I hope that there continue to be opportunities like this locally to learn more about Data Analytics!
