Do you want something? Go get it. 

Did your wife just tell you she wants another vacation? Instead of feeling bad, 
earn the money and stop spending frivolously. Want to work for yourself? Stop 
dreaming about it and work for it. Want a better physique? Good. Get to the gym. 

What's the point? Nothing comes for free. You have to earn these things. No 
matter how easy it seems other peoples' lives are, you aren't them. Go do the 
work it takes. There is no substitute for hard work. 

Working hard once isn't enough, either. You need build a process and be 
disciplined and followed it. Every day. **Every. Freaking. Day.**

Will it work out immediately? Nope. It is going to take a lot longer than you 
think. Be patient. Life is an accumulation of the little things you've done 
extra. Life is also asymmetrical. Know the saying, "the straw that broke the 
camel's back?" All of a sudden, you'll tip the balance and things will happen. 
The dam can only hold back so much water... then watch out!

The fact is that it will take a long time. And then it won't work out. And then 
something else. It's hard. People will doubt you. You'll doubt you. You have to 
take it. You have to take it again and again. Oh. And you need to be calm about 
all of it. 

As I write these lines, I realize (again) that Rudyard Kipling's poem *If* has 
already said this [better]:

>If you can keep your head when all about you   
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
    But make allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,

The last thing I will say: even when you do all of this, you still need to be 
lucky. Life is literally a crap shoot. That's not to say you can use this as a 
cop out... you can keep putting yourself into the path of luck and soon it will 
feel more like you're reading the tea leaves. 

Work hard. Be disciplined. Be patient. Get lucky. Wait for the good times to 
roll (and then start all over).
