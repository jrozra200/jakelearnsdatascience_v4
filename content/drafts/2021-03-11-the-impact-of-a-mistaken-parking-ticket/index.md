# BRAINSTORM

This is a post on the parking ticket I recieved, easy solutions, and the potential impact it may have on the already disenfranchised. 

1. Tell the story about how the ticket was gotten
2. The customer experience sucks - I should be able to call in and get it fixed 
or better yet, go online and fix it myself
3. The second order effects of having to go downtown to and in front of a judge to 
get it fixed are extremely heavy on the already disenfranchised.
