### INTRODUCTION

My wife introduced me to cycling in 2014 - I fell in love with it and went all 
in. That first summer after buying my bike, I rode over 500 miles (more on that 
below). My neighbors at the time, also cyclists, introduced me to the app
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/). Ever since then, I've tracked all of my rides, 
runs, hikes, walks (perhaps not really exercise that needs to be tracked... but 
I hurt myself early in 2018 and that's all I could do for a while), etc.
everything I could, I tracked. 

I got curious and found a package, [rStrava](https://github.com/fawda123/rStrava), 
where I can download all of my activity. Once I had it, I put it into a few 
visualizations.

### ESTABLISH STRAVA AUTHENTICATION

First thing I had to do was set up a Strava account and application. I found 
some really nice instructions on 
[another blog](http://www.open-thoughts.com/2017/01/the-quantified-cyclist-analysing-strava-data-using-r/) 
that helped walk me through this. 

After that, I installed rStrava and set up authentication (you only have to do 
this the first time).

```{r getting_auth_setup, eval = FALSE}
## INSTALLING THE NECESSARY PACKAGES
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('fawda123/rStrava')

## LOAD THE LIBRARY
library(rStrava)

## ESTABLISH THE APP CREDENTIALS
name <- 'jakelearnsdatascience' 
client_id  <- '31528' 
secret <- 'MY_SECRET_KEY'

## CREATE YOUR STRAVA TOKEN
token <- httr::config(token = strava_oauth(name, client_id, secret, app_scope = "read_all",
                                           cache = TRUE)) 
## cache = TRUE is optional - but it saves your token to the working directory
```

### GET MY EXERCISE DATA

Now that authentication is setup, using the **rStrava** package to pull activity 
data is relatively straightforward.

```{r hide_oauth_local, echo = FALSE}
oauth_location <- ".httr-oauth"
```

```{r get_strava_data}
library(rStrava)

## LOAD THE TOKEN (AFTER THE FIRST TIME)
stoken <- httr::config(token = readRDS(oauth_location)[[1]])

## GET STRAVA DATA USING rStrava FUNCTION FOR MY ATHLETE ID
my_act <- get_activity_list(stoken)
```

This function returns a list of activities. class(my_act): `r class(my_act)`.

In my case, there are `r length(my_act)` activies. 

### FORMATTING THE DATA

To make the data easier to work with, I convert it to a data frame. There are 
many more fields than I've selected below - these are all I want for this post. 

```{r convert_to_df}
info_df <- data.frame()
for(act in 1:length(my_act)){
        tmp <- my_act[[act]]
        
        tmp_df <- data.frame(name = tmp$name,
                             type = tmp$type,
                             distance = tmp$distance,
                             moving_time = tmp$moving_time,
                             elapsed_time = tmp$elapsed_time,
                             start_date = tmp$start_date_local,
                             total_elevation_gain = tmp$total_elevation_gain,
                             trainer = tmp$trainer,
                             manual = tmp$manual,
                             average_speed = tmp$average_speed,
                             max_speed = tmp$max_speed)
        
        info_df <- rbind(info_df, tmp_df)
}
```

I want to convert a few fields to units that make more sense for me (miles, 
feet, hours instead of meters and seconds). I've also created a number of features, 
though I've suppressed the code here. You can see all of the code on 
[github](https://github.com/jrozra200/jakelearnsdatascience_v2/blob/master/content/post/2019-01-09-visualizing-data-from-strava.Rmd).

```{r feature_creation, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

info_df$miles <- info_df$distance / 1609.34 # CONVERT METERS TO MILES
info_df$moving_time_hour <- info_df$moving_time / 3600 # CONVERT SECONDS TO HOURS
info_df$avg_mph <- info_df$miles / info_df$moving_time_hour # CALCULATE MPH
info_df$total_elevation_gain_ft <- info_df$total_elevation_gain * 
        3.28084 # CONVERT METERS TO FEET

# CONVERT STRING DATE TO DATE CLASS
info_df$start_date <- as.Date(info_df$start_date, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ") 
info_df <- info_df[info_df$start_date <= "2019-01-01", ]
info_df$mon <- month(info_df$start_date) # PULL OUT THE MONTH (FOR GROUPING)
info_df$year <- year(info_df$start_date) # PULL OUT THE YEAR (FOR GROUPING)

# RENAME ACTIVITIES WHERE APPROPRIATE
info_df$activity <- ifelse(grepl("soccer", tolower(info_df$name)), "Soccer",
                           ifelse(info_df$type == "Run" & info_df$trainer == TRUE,
                                  "Treadmill",
                                  ifelse(info_df$type == "Ride" & info_df$trainer == TRUE,
                                         "Peloton", as.character(info_df$type))))

info_df <- info_df[info_df$activity != "Workout", ] # REMOVE PLAIN GYM WORKOUTS

# ORDER ACTIVITIES TO GET THE CUMULATIVE SUM OF MILES
info_df <- info_df[order(info_df$start_date, decreasing = FALSE), ]
info_df$total_sum <- cumsum(info_df$miles) # CALCULATE THE OVERALL CUMULATIVE MILES

# FOR EACH UNIQUE ACTIVITY, CALCULATE THE CUMULATIVE SUM
info_sum <- data.frame()
for(act in unique(info_df$activity)){
        tmp <- info_df[info_df$activity == act, ]
        
        tmp$act_cum <- cumsum(tmp$miles)
        
        info_sum <- rbind(info_sum, tmp)
}

## FINALLY - LET'S GROUP THE ACTIVITIES BY MONTH FOR A RIDGEPLOT
mon_sum <- as.data.frame(info_df %>% group_by(mon, year, activity) %>% 
        summarise(total_elevation_gain_ft = sum(total_elevation_gain_ft),
                  moving_time_hour = sum(moving_time_hour),
                  miles = sum(miles),
                  num_activites = length(unique(start_date))))

## FOR EVERY 5 MILES ON BIKE, EQUATE TO 1 MILE RUN
mon_sum$adjusted_miles <- ifelse(mon_sum$activity == "Ride" | 
                                         mon_sum$activity == "Peloton",
                                 mon_sum$miles / 5, mon_sum$miles)

## PROBABLY NOT THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO DO IT, BUT ADD IN 0s FOR 
## WHERE THERE ARE NO ACTIVITIES
mon_sum_fin <- data.frame()
for(yr in 2014:2019){
        for(mn in 1:12){
                for(act in unique(mon_sum$activity)){
                        if(dim(mon_sum[mon_sum$mon == mn & mon_sum$year == yr & 
                                       mon_sum$activity == act, ])[1] > 0){
                                tmp <- mon_sum[mon_sum$mon == mn & 
                                                       mon_sum$year == yr & 
                                                       mon_sum$activity == act, ]
                        } else {
                                tmp <- data.frame(mon = mn,
                                                  year = yr,
                                                  activity = act, 
                                                  total_elevation_gain_ft = 0,
                                                  moving_time_hour = 0,
                                                  miles = 0, 
                                                  num_activites = 0,
                                                  adjusted_miles = 0)
                        }
                        
                        mon_sum_fin <- rbind(mon_sum_fin, tmp)
                }
        }
}

## CONVERT THE DATE FOR VISUALIZATION
mon_sum_fin$mon_year <- as.Date(strptime(paste(mon_sum_fin$year, 
                                               mon_sum_fin$mon,
                                               "01", sep = "-"), 
                                         "%Y-%m-%d"))

## GET RID OF THE ACTIVIES THAT HAVEN'T HAPPENED
mon_sum_fin <- mon_sum_fin[mon_sum_fin$mon_year >= "2014-08-01" & 
                                   mon_sum_fin$mon_year <= Sys.Date(), ]
```

### HOW FAR HAVE I GONE?

Since `r format(min(info_df$start_date), "%B %d, %Y")`, I have - under my own power - traveled 
`r round(sum(info_df$miles), 2)` miles. There were a few periods without much action 
(a whole year from mid-2016 through later-2017), which is a bit sad. The last 
few months have been good, though. 

```{r overall_cumulative, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggridges)
library(RColorBrewer)

ggplot(data = info_df, aes(x = start_date, y = total_sum)) +
        geom_line() + 
        ggtitle("Cumulative Miles on Strava") +
        xlab("Year") +
        ylab("Miles (cumulative)") +
        theme(panel.background = element_blank(), 
              panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "grey"),
              legend.position = "right", legend.text = element_text(size = 8),
              legend.key = element_rect(fill = 'white'),
              axis.title = element_text(size = 10), axis.text = element_text(size = 10))
```

Here's a similar view, but split by activity. 

* I've been running recently. 
* I haven't really ridden my bike since the first 2 summers I had it. 
* I rode the peloton when we first got it, but not since. 
* I was a walker when I first tore the labrum in my hip in early 2018. 

```{r by_activity, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = info_sum, aes(x = start_date, y = act_cum, color = activity)) +
        geom_line() + 
        ggtitle("Cumulative Miles by Activity on Strava") +
        xlab("Year") +
        ylab("Miles (cumulative)") +
        theme(panel.background = element_blank(), 
              panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "grey"),
              legend.position = "right", legend.text = element_text(size = 8),
              legend.key = element_rect(fill = 'white'),
              axis.title = element_text(size = 10), axis.text = element_text(size = 10)) + 
        scale_color_manual(name = "", 
                           values = colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(name = "Blues", n = 8))(length(unique(info_sum$activity))))
```

Finally, here's the same data again, but split up in a 
[ridgeplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html).

```{r ridgeplot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(mon_sum_fin, aes(x = mon_year, y = activity, fill = activity, height = adjusted_miles)) +
        geom_density_ridges(stat = "identity", scale = 0.9) +
        theme_ridges() + 
        theme(legend.position = "none") + 
        scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues") + 
        xlab("Year") + 
        ylab("Activity")
```

### SUMMARY

There's a TON of data that is returned by the Strava API. This blog just 
scratches the surface of analysis that is possible - mostly I am just 
introducing how to get the data and get up and running. 

As a new year's resolution, I've committed to run 312 miles this year. That is 
6 miles per week for 52 weeks (for those trying to wrap their head around the 
weird number). Now that I've been able to pull this data, I'll have to set up 
a tracker/dashboard for that data. More to come!
