For those of you who aren't stirred from bed in the small hours to learn data 
science, you might have missed that March 5th was 
[international open data day](http://opendataday.org/). There are hundreds of 
local events around the world; I was lucky enough to attend 
[DC's Open Data Day Hackathon](http://dc.opendataday.org/). I met a bunch of 
great people doing noble things with data who taught me a crap-ton (scientific 
term) and also validated my love for data science and how much I've learned 
since beginning my journey almost two years ago. Here is a quick rundown of 
what I learned and some helpful links so that you can find out more, too. 
Being that it is an **Open** Data event, everything was well documented on the 
[hackathon hackpad](https://opendatadaydc.hackpad.com/Open-Data-Day-DC-2016-JKV5PVjx8T3).

### Introduction to Open Data

[Eric Mill](https://twitter.com/konklone) gave an really nice overview of what 
JSON is how to use APIs to access the JSON and thus, the data the website is 
conveying. Though many APIs are open and documented, many are not. Eric gave 
some tips on how to access that data, too.

This session really opened my eyes to how to access that previously unusable 
data that was hidden in plain sight in the text of websites.

### Data Science Primer

This was one of the highlights for me - A couple of NIST Data Scientists, Pri 
Oberoi and Star Ying, gave a presentation and walkthrough on how to use 
[k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) to 
identify groupings in your data. The data and jupyter notebook is available on 
[github](https://github.com/jrozra200/open_data_day_dc_k_means_sample).

I will definitely be using this in my [journey to better detect and remediate 
compromised user accounts at Comcast](https://www.jakelearnsdatascience.com/posts/identifying-compromised-user-accounts/).

### Hackathon

I joined a group that was working to use data science to 
[identify Opioid overuse](https://opendatadaydc.hackpad.com/Opioid-over-use-prescription-using-CT-CMS-data-vzWwLHSlVDR). 
Though I didn't add much (the group was filled with some really really smart 
people), I was able to 
[visualize the data](http://jrozra200.github.io/opiod_hackathon_open_data_day_dc/) 
using R and [share](https://github.com/jrozra200/opiod_hackathon_open_data_day_dc) 
some of those techniques with the team.

### Intro to D3 Visualizations

The [last session](https://opendatadaydc.hackpad.com/Intro-to-D3-issXcwlDxKp) and 
probably my favorite was a tutorial on building out a 
[D3 Visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D3.js). 
[Chris Given](https://twitter.com/cmgiven) walked a packed house through building 
a D3 viz step-by-step, giving some background on why things work they work and 
showing some great resources.

I am particularly proud of the 
[results](https://www.jakelearnsdatascience.com/projects/d3_sample_open_data_day_dc/) 
(though I only followed his instruction to build this).

### Closing

I also attended [2](https://github.com/JessicaGarson/Open-Data-Day-Intro-to-Coding) 
[sessions](https://opendatadaydc.hackpad.com/En4gCF99otc#Shell-Scripting) about 
using the command line that totally demystified the shell prompt. All in all, 
it was a great two days! I will definitely be back next year (unless I can 
convince someone to do one in Philly).
